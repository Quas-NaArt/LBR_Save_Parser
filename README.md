# LBR_Save_Parser
A script to parse Leaf Blower Revolution save files for relevant information, and output them as a CSV for use in associated community calculator spreadsheets, especially [my own, which drove the script's philosophy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eCzTBhnAnHP1upOT-iR7LqM1t-NUKFZiySDvdV-LeFE/edit#gid=1969717219).

## Usage
By default, the game saves to `%localappdata%/blow_the_leaves_away/save.dat` in binary-encoded base64, so the script reads from that location and decodes it before working. The data is processed and organized, and the output is saved to LBR_Save.csv on your Windows Desktop.

You can run [the native Python script, leaf_blower_save_reader.py](leaf_blower_save_reader.py) in your Python interpreter if you have one installed, or you can run [the autogenerated .exe export, leaf_blower_save_reader.exe](output/leaf_blower_save_reader.exe) if you prefer. Either one can be downloaded individually, without having to clone/unzip this entire repository.

CLI hooks for different read/write locations have been requested. I'll probably allow for single files by CLI directly, or batch processing through the use of another file describing the associated lists of input/output locations.
